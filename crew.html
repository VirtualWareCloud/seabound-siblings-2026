          <h2>Jessie</h2>
          <p>Having grown up in various foster homes, I learned to be independent from a very young age. Despite life’s many uncertainties, I remained driven—graduating high school with five distinctions and funding my first year of law at Wits University by juggling three jobs. Education, to me, was always the path to break the cycle of instability I had witnessed growing up.

“Having grown up in foster care meant that I had to stand on my own two feet early. I’ve always believed that education would be my way forward. But I wouldn’t have come this far without the unwavering support of my sisters and the mentors who believed in me.”

At 21, I found myself burnt out and boxed in—what I called feeling like a "Jess-in-a-box." That’s when I made the bold decision to take a gap year and enter the yachting industry. My goal was simple: to travel and save enough to continue my studies. That leap of faith opened a new chapter in my life, one filled with adventure, learning, and global connection.

“Life is about taking risks. I’d rather try and fail than live with the regret of never having tried at all.”

Seven years later, I’ve not only completed a Bachelor’s degree in Education, but I’ve also grown into a seasoned maritime professional. My yachting career has taken me around the world—working aboard both private and charter sailing vessels in roles ranging from deckhand to stewardess, cook, and chief stewardess. I’ve earned my Day Skipper license, crossed the Atlantic four times, and even delivered a yacht from Cape Town to Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alongside my seafaring career, I’ve stayed grounded in my passion: working with children. As a qualified teacher specializing in supporting learners with barriers to learning, I draw deeply from my own experiences. A few years ago, I worked at a school that ran an NGO for abandoned babies—something incredibly close to my heart. In 2023, I taught at an international school in Thailand, and now, I’m preparing to return to sea once more before finally anchoring myself on land for the next chapter.

“Being near water is where I feel most at peace. It’s where I heal, reflect, and reconnect with the world. And working with children is where I find my purpose.”

The journey has been anything but ordinary—but it’s shaped me into someone who believes fiercely in giving back. I envision a future where I can mentor children facing adversity, just as I once did. That is, without a doubt, my life’s purpose.

“The bond of family is something ever-enduring—no matter the space, time, or distance.”

“It’s simple: if you can dream it, you can do it.”</p>

          <h2>Melissa</h2>
          <p>I was fortunate to finish high school thanks to my foster parents, who welcomed me into their home and treated me as one of their own. Coming from an unstable early background, I longed for purpose and refused to be defined by my past. Driven by the desire to create a better future, I made the decision to go overseas with the goal of saving enough to fund my studies.

I did save enough—but when the time came to choose a path, I struggled. I’ve always been deeply curious, drawn to so many different things, and I couldn't settle on just one. In the end, I followed my heart—and it led me to the sea.

What started in the cruise shipping industry eventually evolved into a career in yachting, where I began at the very bottom and worked my way up. Through perseverance, grit, and determination, I earned my Chief Mate 3000 Yachts certification by combining extensive sea time with advanced maritime studies. I also hold my PADI Dive Master qualification and recently completed my Yacht Purser Course—all of which I know will prove invaluable during our upcoming Atlantic row.

Now, with over 12 years at sea, I’ve witnessed the beauty of the ocean—and its vulnerability. One experience that left a lasting impact on me occurred during a crossing to the Maldives, when we discovered a sea turtle trapped in a mass of floating plastic. We were able to stop and free it, but the damage had already been done. The ocean, my second home, is under threat—and I initially planned to support a charity focused on protecting marine life from plastic pollution.

But this year, our family suffered a devastating loss: our 21-year-old nephew tragically took his own life. The grief was overwhelming—and it brought to light how prevalent and pressing the issue of mental health truly is, especially in high-stress environments like the maritime industry, where suicide rates are alarmingly high. Because of this, I’ve chosen to support a mental health charity, to raise awareness and help others who may be struggling in silence.

“What inspires me? I don't want to live with regrets. You get one life—make it count. Step out of your comfort zone, push your limits mentally and physically, work hard, and be the best version of yourself.”

This row across the Atlantic will be the biggest, most demanding challenge I’ve ever faced—but also the most meaningful. Life itself is a daily challenge, but this? This is something else. And I couldn’t be more excited to take it on with my sister by my side in 2026..</p>
